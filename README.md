# 🌍 AI-Driven Disaster Management Prototype  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project is a **software-based AI-driven disaster management prototype** that provides an end-to-end solution for effective disaster response. It predicts disaster-prone zones, detects incidents, allocates resources, and enables smooth communication between authorities and citizens.  

The system includes:  
- **Risk Prediction**: Predict vulnerable areas using simulated data.  
- **Incident Detection**: Monitor real-time alerts and SOS requests.  
- **Resource Allocation & Routing**: Optimize allocation of ambulances, boats, and trucks.  
- **Authority Dashboard**: Centralized view of disasters, resources, trends, and insights.  
- **Citizen Communication**: Simulated multilingual alerts & SOS reporting.  

---

## 📊 Features  
- Live dashboard (incidents, resources, alerts, response time).  
- Interactive charts (resource utilization & trends).  
- User insights (active users, SOS requests).  
- Responsive Tailwind-based UI with a modern command center feel.  
- Simulation logic using **JavaScript** for dynamic updates.  

---

## ⚙️ Workflow  
**Step 1: Data Input**  
- Weather forecasts, historical data, official warnings, and citizen SOS requests.  

**Step 2: AI Processing**  
- Predict risk zones.  
- Detect incidents in real time.  
- Optimize allocation of limited resources.  

**Step 3: Visualization**  
- Authority dashboard with graphs, maps, alerts, and resource stats.  
- Citizen app view with SOS & shelter locator.  

**Step 4: Communication**  
- Multilingual alerts via SMS/notifications.  
- Citizen → Authority → Resource routing loop.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (ECharts.js for graphs).  
- **Backend (Future)**: Node.js / Python (Flask/FastAPI).  
- **Data Sources (Future)**: IMD weather warnings, ISRO flood maps, NDMA dashboards.  

---

## 🔮 Future Plans  
1. **Real Data Integration** – Link with IMD, ISRO, and NDMA live feeds.  
2. **Offline-Ready Apps** – Support for disaster zones with poor connectivity.  
3. **AI Optimization** – Smarter routing using reinforcement learning.  
4. **Citizen Mobile App** – Android/iOS app with SOS & shelter navigation.  
5. **Multi-Disaster Support** – Floods, earthquakes, landslides, wildfires.  
6. **Scalability** – Expand from local district to state/national level.

## 📷 Demo (Prototype UI)  
- Live dashboard with simulated updates every 5 seconds.  
- Animated graphs showing incidents vs. resources.  
- User insights panel (active users, SOS requests).
